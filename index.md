Welcome to Hugo by Example. This site is intended to be a useful
resource for those wanting to learn to use
[Hugo](http://generalcoffee.com/hugo/gethugo.html) to develop
Interactive Fiction games.

Hugo is a very well designed system for creating games. It can create
quite large games, and it also makes it very easy to add multimedia
effects to the game (pictures, videos and music.)

Some popular games that were created in Hugo include:

-   [Fallacy of Dawn](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=n8ngm7hx5z5e9csz)
    by Robb Sherwin
-   [Guilty Bastards](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=g02gj35cieg77y62)
    by Kent Tessman
-   [Tales of the Traveling Swordsman](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=fsujzka1ua0h5att) by
    Mike Snyder
-   [Future Boy!](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=v0a4wtgwepxumryc) by
    Kent Tessman (this game showcases some of the multimedia
    capabilities of Hugo)

**2021 Update-**
Hugo by Example has found a new home here on github thanks to the efforts of Juhana Leinonen!  For the near future, attention will be concentrated on updating remaining dead links and outdated information, but after that, we'll give some more attention to some of the Hugo progress that has occurred since HxE originally went offline- things like Roodylib (the Hugo library extension) and the new interpreter opcode system.  Welcome back!
