Welcome to Hugo by Example. This site is intended to be a useful
resource for those wanting to learn to use
[Hugo](http://generalcoffee.com/hugo/gethugo.html) to develop
Interactive Fiction games. 

Hugo is a very well designed system for creating games. It can create
quite large games, and it also makes it very easy to add multimedia
effects to the game (Pictures, videos and music)

Some popular games that were created in Hugo include:
