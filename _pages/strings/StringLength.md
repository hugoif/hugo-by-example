| `StringLength(array1)` | Returns the length of the string array `array1` |

### Uses in games

Mike Snyder's *Distress* used it to measure strings for his own
text-centering routine (`PrintCenter` in misc.hug)
Kent Tessman's *Future Boy!* used it to make sure dialogue choices for
his menu-based conversation system fit well no matter what the 
[display screen width](/guts/display-object/) was.
