`cheapglk` is the bare-bones version of [glk](/definitions/glk/). Cheapglk
codebases are often used for non-traditional IF environments, like when
someone writes a play-IF-by-instant-message bot (or an IRC bot or what
have you)- environments where fonts and things are ignored completely.
The status window may not even be printed at all. `cheapglk`
interpreters are not used *often*, but it still can be good to make your
game cheapglk-friendly, as the bot used in
[ClubFloyd](http://www.allthingsjacq.com/interactive_fiction.html#clubfloyd)
on the [ifMUD](http://ifmud.port4000.com) uses a cheapglk interpreter.
