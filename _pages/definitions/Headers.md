"Headers" can refer to several different things:

1.  It can refer to the "verb" or "xverb" notation in
    [grammar](/basics/grammar/)-definition.
2.  It can refer to the ".h" and ".hug" files that comprise a game's
    source. Furthermore, when these files are precompiled, they are
    referred to as "[precompiled headers](/definitions/precompiled-headers/)."
3.  The "header" can also refer to the first several bytes of a compiled
    file, reserved to hold specific information. For instance, in a .HEX
    game file, the 64 byte header holds the Hugo version the game was
    compiled with, the ID string, and the serial number (among several
    other things). 
    *See page 226 of [The Hugo Book](/hugo/hugo-book/) for more information.*
