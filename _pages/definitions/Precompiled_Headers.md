*Precompiled headers* are what their name suggests- sections of a game
that are precompiled. This way, each time someone compiles a new build,
it doesn't take quite as long as it would to compile the entire thing.
Mostly, this is a legacy feature from when computers were much slower,
where a single full compilation could take dozens of seconds or even
several minutes.

As it is not even recommended to compile your final build using
precompiled headers (as the game will be bulkier and less
memory-efficient), we won't reiterate how to compile them here. Rest
assured, it's all covered in [The Hugo Book](/hugo/hugo-book/)
if you are in need.
