An **identifier** is the name of a [constant](constants) or a
[variable](variables) such as an
[attribute](attribute), a [global](global),
[local](local), or a [property](properties).
Identifiers in Hugo must start with a letter, then followed by zero or
more letters, numbers or underscores. The maximum permitted length of an
identifier is 32 characters. Identifiers are not case sensitive, so the
identifiers [Player](Player), PLAYER, plaYer or PlayEr are
the same single identifier.
