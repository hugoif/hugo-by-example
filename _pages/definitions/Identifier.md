An **identifier** is the name of a [constant](/basics/constants/) or a
[variable](/basics/variables/) such as an
[attribute](/attributes/), a [global](/basics/global/),
local, or a [property](/properties/).
Identifiers in Hugo must start with a letter, then followed by zero or
more letters, numbers or underscores. The maximum permitted length of an
identifier is 32 characters. Identifiers are not case sensitive, so the
identifiers [Player](/globals/player/), PLAYER, plaYer or PlayEr are
the same single identifier.
