The `enterable` [attribute](/attributes/) allows
[platforms](/basics/containers-and-platforms/) and
[containers](/basics/containers-and-platforms/) to be entered by the player. In
fact, it doesn't even need to be a platform or container. With the
`enterable` attribute, the player can enter the object, period. The
[vehicle class](/classes/vehicle/) is a good example of an object with
the `enterable` attribute.
