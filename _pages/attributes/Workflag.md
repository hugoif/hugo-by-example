**workflag** is a predefined [attribute](/attributes/) used
solely by the library (specifically, it is used for some of the
"CheckHeld" routines). As such, it is unlikely an author would need it
in that capacity. It is an [alias](/basics/alias/) for the attribute
[already_listed](/attributes/already_listed/).
