`transparent` is an [attribute](attributes/) given to
[containers](basics/containers-and-platforms/) and
[characters](characters/) to signify that the player can
always see what the object is being held, even if the container is
currently not [open](attributes/open/). In the case of a closed,
transparent container, its contents are listed just as if the object
were open. In the case of a character, his or her possessions, by
default, get listed with their descriptions:

>Start Location  
>Bill is here. Bill has a chainsaw.
>
>&gt;
