`special` is the [misc](properties/misc/) of
[attributes](attributes/). It is just one extra attribute put
aside for miscellaneous use. Used sparingly, it is a convenient way to
do a lot of small object-state checks without needing to create new
attributes. Used extensively, it can hurt the game code's readability
(unless also extensively commented).
