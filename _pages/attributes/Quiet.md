A [container](container) with the `quiet`
[attribute](attribute) will not have its contents listed
either in room listings or when a player looks at it. If the player uses
the **&gt;LOOK IN** command and successfully sees the object's contents,
though, the `quiet` attribute is cleared. The `quiet` attribute can also
be cleared by entering a `quiet` object. This behavior lends itself to a
sense of "discovery."
