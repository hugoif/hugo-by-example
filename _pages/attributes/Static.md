`static` is an [attribute](attributes) given to objects that
can't be moved or taken. The default response for trying to move a
static object is a variation of, "You can't move that." Taking gets a
variation of, "You can't take that." When combined with the
[living](living) attribute (as is done with characters), you
get a response like, "&lt;character&gt; probably wouldn't be too big on that
idea."
