`worn` is an [attribute](/attributes/) given to
[clothing](/attributes/clothing/) objects to signify that they should not
count towards a player's [holding](/properties/holding/) property. Also,
in inventory lists, objects with the `worn` attribute will be followed
by " (being worn)" text (unless there is a
[desc_detail](/properties/desc_detail/) property to override it).
