`open` is an [attribute](/attributes/) given to objects that
are, um, open. It is often- but not always- paired with
[openable](/attribute/openable/).

**Instances where `open` is used:**

-   An always-open [container](/attributes/container/) like a cauldron.
-   An [openable](/attribute/openable/)/closeable `container` like a
    treasure chest.
-   An [openable](/attribute/openable/)/closeable non-container like a
    [door](/classes/doors/).
