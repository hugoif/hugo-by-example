`open` is an [attribute](attributes/) given to objects that
are, um, open. It is often- but not always- paired with
[openable](attributes/openable/).

**Instances where `open` is used:**

-   An always-open [container](attributes/container/) like a cauldron.
-   An [openable](attributes/openable/)/closeable `container` like a
    treasure chest.
-   An [openable](attributes/openable/)/closeable non-container like a
    [door](classes/doors/).
