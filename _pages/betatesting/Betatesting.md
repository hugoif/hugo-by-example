"Betatesting" is the process of distributing one's game among a limited
number of people before its eventual release. This way, other players
can find bugs and suggest improvements that the author wouldn't
necessarily find or think of himself or herself.

[The IF Wiki](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Betatesting) has a useful
page containing links to sites that offer betatesting services and
articles on betatesting.
