"Roodylib" is the name of a library addition that compiles a bunch of
standard library fixes and adds several utility routines. It is very
much a work in progress, but you can download the latest version
[here](http://roody.gerynarsabode.org/notdead/roodylib_suite.zip).

*The latest version number is 2.1*

Changelog-

v 2.1 - Added new plural class features, extra_scenery code
(extra_scenery in player_character object is now always treated as
extra scenery, not just current location's extra_scenery)
