`PastTense` is a library contribution for games that are told in the
past tense- either in part or their entirety. You can download it
[here](http://roody.gerynarsabode.org/hbe/pasttense.h).

### Usage

Just include "pasttense.h" after "verblib.h"/"verbstub.h" and set the
[global variable](basics/global/) `pasttense` to
*true* when you want the game to be past tense.
