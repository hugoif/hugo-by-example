The following is a list of mostly free programs that are useful for
writing or plotting out a game.

### Mapping

[GUEmap](http://www.cjmweb.net/GUEmap/) is a mapping program that is
great for plotting out the room layout of your future game. Of course,
it is also useful for mapping out other people's games, too.

[Trizbort](https://www.trizbort.com/) is another
fine mapping program. It doesn't have some of the quick keyboard
shortcuts that GUEmap has, but it makes much prettier maps. Plus, it has
an automap feature that works off of game transcripts.

### File Comparison

Let's say you hacked up one of the
[IF Archive Hugo library contributions](https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/programming/hugo/library/contributions/)
in an ugly fashion to work exactly like you'd like. Eventually, you
might want to remind yourself exactly how it is different.
[WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) is perfect for this. It'll show both
files side by side, highlighting the differences.

### Multiple File Code Search

If your text editor of choice does not have a "Find in Files" feature that allows you to
search whole directories for specific text, [TextCrawler](http://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/content/textcrawler/manual)
is a good standalone program.  For instance, if you are unsure about a function in Hugo, you can use a program like this
to search other people's Hugo games to see if they used whatever you need some clarification on.
