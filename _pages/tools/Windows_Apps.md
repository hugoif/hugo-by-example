The following is a list of mostly free programs that are useful for
writing or plotting out a game.

### Mapping

[GUEmap](http://www.cjmweb.net/GUEmap/)is a mapping program that is
great for plotting out the room layout of your future game. Of course,
it is also useful for mapping out other people's games, too.

[Trizbort](http://trizbort.genstein.net/index.php#overview) is another
fine mapping program. It doesn't have some of the quick keyboard
shortcuts that GUEmap has, but it makes much prettier maps. Plus, it has
an automap feature that works off of game transcripts.

### Design

[Text Block Writer](http://roody.gerynarsabode.org/hbe/TextBlockWriterSetup.exe) is
a virtual index card program for writers. You can use it to plan out
what objects you will need to code for rooms in advance.

The website it originated from is currently defunct, but the license
allows for free distribution.

### File Comparison

Let's say you hacked up one of the
[IF Archive Hugo library contributions](http://ifarchive.smallwhitehouse.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXhugoXlibraryXcontributions.html)
in an ugly fashion to work exactly like you'd like. Eventually, you
might want to remind yourself exactly how it is different.
[WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) is perfect for this. It'll show both
files side by side, highlighting the differences.

### Multiple File Code Search

Download all of the example game code off of the IF Archive and use a
program like
[TextCrawler](http://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/content/textcrawler/manual)
to quickly find out which games have example code for that routine or
function that is giving you trouble. You can even configure it so
clicking on a search result automatically opens up the file at the part
of interest (you'll have to look up the command line options of your
text editor to do so).
