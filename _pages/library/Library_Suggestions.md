This is a page for us to add suggestions on what kind of things we'd
like to see in the Hugo Standard Library (should Mr. Tessman ever decide
to revisit it, or if one of us decides to do a rewrite and unleash it
upon the world).

### New Properties

New/improved property ideas go here (remember that name, before, after,
noun, adjective and article are hard-coded into the compiler)

-   *[Dynamic Name](tips/dynamic-name/)* - This feature (called
    **dynname**) causes the name of a room to be created dynamically,
    that is, programmatically. I had to put it in because changing the
    "name" property on a room in some cases triggered a "MORE" prompt
    and stopped for the user to type a character. I now realize there is
    a simpler way to do this.

### New Attributes

The standard [attributes](attributes/) are okay, but sometimes
you may want to do something different in a game. Here are a few
suggestions you might use for attributes that aren't in the predefined
list, but are useful for things in your game. And included are ideas on
what a particular attribute might be used for. Some of these are
duplicates of others, but the idea is to help you find the right name
for an attribute, so that, for example, you have **silent** or **noisy**
depending on which way you wanted to emphasize the situation. Some of
these you could modify by putting **UN** or **NOT** in front. Some of
these might be combined, so you have Cold_Money to indicate some that
was hidden in a freezer, Wet_Paint,
Incoming_Teleport/Outgoing_Teleport, etc.

-   **Abandoned** - Changes the description, make it more gothic.
-   **Ammo** - that which reloads a **Weapon**, you can create a
    [property](properties/) or another attribute to say what
    kind, but you can just put a check in, if you had a "reload"
    command, if the item they want to reload isn't ammo, then you just
    ignore it
-   **Animal** - Something may be alive as a **character** but you can
    declare an **animal** if the person wants a horse or a dog around
-   **Bankrupt** - If you have a multi-player trading game, the ones
    that go bankrupt can be skipped
-   **Better** - opposed to **worse** or **used** or **wornout**
-   **Blocked** - might be temporarily blocked, or something closed it
-   **Borrowed** - something that was **loaned**
-   **Broken** - the user broke it or it failed
-   **Breakable** - might be something you can break as opposed to
    something **solid**
-   **Clean** - Your car is now no longer **dirty**
-   **Coin** - a valid form of **money** as opposed to a **slug**
-   **Cold** - Perhaps too cold to handle, or the room is cold
-   **Collapsed** - it failed, like a cave in, or **crushed**
-   **Conveyor** - takes you through a number of places, or try a
    **teleport**, **escalator**, **elevator** etc.
-   **Crushed** - as opposed to being in good order, or **collapsed**
-   **Damaged** - something needing to be **repaired**
-   **Dead** or **Deceased** - The **living** attribute tells if
    something is a character, but what if you've killed them, or what if
    you're doing a **zombie**?
-   **Deadly** - Entering this room or touching an item with this
    attribute makes you sick or kills you, perhaps instantly
-   **Defective** - Really badly busted, or maybe **wornout** beyond its
    useful limits
-   **Depleted** - Worn out Uranium is still very hard, and "depleted
    uranium" has a lot of military uses (or it might be for something
    that isn't **radioactive**)
-   **Dirty** - until you **clean** the car, people keep writing "Wash
    Me" on the windows with the grime
-   **Done** - some things might be **InProgress** because they take
    multiple turns, and some might indicate they're **done**
-   **Down** - Position of a two-floor elevator or direction of an
    escalator, or **up**; could also mean a non-working computer or
    device
-   **Dripping** - Has a small leak or is slightly **wet**. Bigger leaks
    could use **leaking**
-   **Dry** (or **Wet**)
-   **Dusty** - as opposed to **dirty** or **clean**
-   **Eaten** - You throw out pieces of meat, if they're partially
    eaten, you know that an animal has touched them
-   **Edible** - Plants that you can safely eat. Or **Inedible**
-   **Elevator** - You might specifically identify something as one, as
    opposed to **transport** or **escalator**
-   **Empty** - Out of ammo, out of gas, or something else
-   **Escalator** - or **elevator**, or **transport** or **conveyor**
-   **Fast** - as opposed to just **quick** or possibly **slow**
-   **Flat** - Bad condition for a tire or soda
-   **Flame** - Something on fire, or a lover
-   **Flammable** - Can burn, and technically the right word is
    **Inflammable** but most people use this
-   **Floating** - as opposed to it sitting on the ground
-   **Food** - Something edible
-   **Free** - In a store, some things might be free; taking them
    doesn't cause you to be suspected of shoplifting
-   **Fresh** - Don't want **stale** food or **frozen** food
-   **Frozen** - as opposed to **thawed**
-   **Fuel** - Similar to **ammo**, if someone tries to fuel something
    and the item isn't marked as fuel, you don't have to check, you just
    refuse it
-   **Full** - The garbage needs to be taken out
-   **Glass** - something is **solid** and perhaps transparent, but it
    could be a type of wall that is also **blocked** until it **broken**
-   **Glasses** - You might be blind without them, or you might be
    drinking from them; or might be **broken** as opposed to your good
    ones
-   **Goggles** - May give you extra vision capability when combined
    with the standard **worn** attribute
-   **Gold** - You might distinguish, say, gold from fools gold when ore
    is found in a mine

    truck
-   **Hot** - Possibly too hot to handle or causes burns, or the room is
    hot

    modifier for some other **transport** or **conveyor** or

-   **InProgress** - Something might require several turns to
    accomplish, so it's **inprogress** until **done**

    **Dry**, **NOTUsed** instead of **NEW**, **NotNew**, **NotFrozen**

### New Functions

-   Ordinal - This function creates the 2-letter extension for numbers, 1st, 2nd, 3rd
etc. This handles numbers from 1 to 99.

    routine Ordinal( I )
    {
    ! routine for Hugo Interactive Fiction System to generate the 2-letter extension
    ! for a number, e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.

         J = abs(I)/10             ! Tens Digit
         K = mod(abs(I),10)        ! Units Digit

         if J = 1
            return "th "   ! 10th through 19th
         else

         select K
