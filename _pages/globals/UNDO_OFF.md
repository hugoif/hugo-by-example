`UNDO_OFF` is a [hugolib.h](library/hugolib.h/)-defined 
[global variable](basics/global/). When set to a true value, players are not
allowed to use the **[UNDO](parsing/undo/)** command both at the
normal text prompt or in the [EndGame](routines/endgame/) routine
("Would you like to (R)ESTART, (R)ESTORE...").
