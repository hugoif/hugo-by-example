Interested in checking out Hugo but don't know where to start?
Hopefully, this page can help!

## Get a text editor

If you're new to coding, you'll find that having a nice text editor with
syntax coloring will go a long ways towards making code easier to
understand. Download a program [here](/tools/editors/)
(gedit, EditPlus, and Notepad++ are some good ones) and install the
accompanying syntax file. If you need to configure the syntax file
within the program, be sure to associate it with **.h**, **.g**, and
**.hug** files.

## Look at a sample game

Now that you have a text editor fit for Hugo source code, download
[The Vault of Hugo](http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/hugo/examples/sample.hug)
and open it up with that aforementioned editor. The Vault of Hugo, while
written for Hugo 2.5, is still *current enough* to be a good
representation of Hugo code, and it utilizes more of Hugo's features
than the average game. There's a lot going on there, so if it seems too
complicated, don't worry.

You can also see the code to several other example games at the
[IF Archive](http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXsourceXhugo.html).

## Get the "shell" file

A quick way of starting to write a new game in Hugo is to start editing
a "shell file," which contains the necessary code base for a game so you
can jump straight into things like your game title and writing rooms and
such.

Here at Hugo by Example, we've been working on a shell file that is a
bit more Hugo 3.0-representative than the file on the IF Archive. You
can find it [here](/basics/new-shell/). So, the first thing you do
when writing a new game is to open up the shell file and save it with a
new name (that'll one day be &lt;new name&gt;.hex, your new Hugo game,
hopefully).

## Get the Hugo software and library

Go to the [IF Archive](http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXhugoXexecutables.html)
(executables section) and look for a version of Hugo for your OS. Be
sure that it is a package that includes a compiler, as some of those
downloads are just interpreters (like the [Hugor](/interpreters/hugor/)
links). Install or unzip the package. Also, download the
[Hugo Library](http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/hugo/library/hugolib.zip).
Unzip that.

## Get and read The Hugo Book

(Of course, there's nothing wrong if you have gotten a head start on
this step. You'll be referring to The Hugo Book a lot.)

Download Roody Yogurt's personal book
[here](http://roody.gerynarsabode.org/hugo_book.pdf). If you're using an
Adobe program, there's a chance you'll be able to see some extra
comments that will offer a tad more light on some things or quicker
navigation. Add more as you get to parts you think you'll want to refer
to!

Anyhow, now that you are armed with a nice editor, you have the power to
write your own little sample code as the Hugo Book teaches concepts to
you. It does a good job of going through things like compiling, too, so
if that worries you, you're in good hands.

Don't worry about getting everything on your first read. As long as you
learn how to write rooms and sort of understand basic object concepts
like [attributes](/attributes/) and
[properties](/properties/), you're good to go!

## Write your game

You should now be ready to get started. If you run into trouble, you
have the Hugo Book, the example games, and this website (including 
[useful tips](/categories/#tips)) at your disposal. You can also
post coding questions at the 
[Jolt Country's Hugo forum](http://www.joltcountry.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=8) or
[intfiction.org's "other languages" forum](http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=16).
Lastly, if you'd like real-time assistance, there's the \#Hugo channel on the
[ifMUD](http://ifmud.port4000.com).
