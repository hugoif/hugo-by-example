The **block statement** is used to indicate a group of statements are
going to be placed in a particular section of code. The block statment
is required to declare the contents of a [routine](routines/),
an [event](timers/events/), a [before](properties/before/) or
[after](properties/after/) section in an object or class, the definition
of an [object](globals/object/) or a class, and
where normally only one single statement is allowed, the block statement
represents the equivalent of one statement.

A block statement begins with the open brace **{** and ends with a close brace **}**.
