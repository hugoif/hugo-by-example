The **block statement** is used to indicate a group of statements are
going to be placed in a particular section of code. The block statment
is required to declare the contents of a [routine](routine),
an [event](event), a [before](before) or
[after](after) section in an object or class, the definition
of an [object](object) or a [class](class), and
where normally only one single statment is allowed, the block statement
represents the equivalent of one statement.

A block statement begins with the open brace **{**, contains the
particular items desired, and ends with a close brace **}**.
