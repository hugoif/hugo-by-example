The `article` [object](object)
[property](properties) often holds indefinite articles like
"a", "an", or "some", but in some instances, it should be "the" (or in
the case of characters with proper names, no `article` property at all).
The general rule of thumb is to envision how you would want the object
listed in the player's inventory ("a newspaper", "some pebbles", "the
thing that your aunt gave you", etc.). When these items are interacted
with directly, Hugo will print the definite article "the" instead.
