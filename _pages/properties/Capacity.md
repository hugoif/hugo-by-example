`capacity` is a [property](Properties) given to
[characters](characters),
[containers](containers), and
[platforms](platforms) which determines how many objects of
[size](size) *x* can fit in/on it/her/him.

Every object defaults to [size](size) 10, so in a game with
no modified `size` properties, a container with `capacity` 100 could
hold 10 items.
