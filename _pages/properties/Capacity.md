`capacity` is a [property](properties/) given to
[characters](characters/),
[containers](basics/containers-and-platforms/), and
[platforms](basics/containers-and-platforms/) which determines how many objects of
[size](properties/size/) *x* can fit in/on it/her/him.

Every object defaults to [size](properties/size/) 10, so in a game with
no modified `size` properties, a container with `capacity` 100 could
hold 10 items.
