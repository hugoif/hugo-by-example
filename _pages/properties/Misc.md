The `misc` [property](/properties/) is just what it sounds like,
an extra, unused property for whatever miscellaneous purpose you have
for it (freeing you from making .

### Possible uses:

-   [Rooms](/basics/rooms/) can use `misc` to hold numbers to use in
    conjunction with [each_turn](/timers/each_turn/) or an
    [event](/timers/events/) to keep track of turns.
-   The player object could use a `misc` property array to keep track of
    clothing objects [worn](/attributes/worn/), when one is separating
    worn objects from the rest of the inventory in &gt;INVENTORY
    responses.
-   The Vault of Hugo uses it to hold the new name for a nameable
    object.
-   And so on!
