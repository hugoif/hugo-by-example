As described, `printchar` is a [print](input-output/print/) command for
printing one character at a time. It is often used for printing
[string array](strings/string-arrays/) elements. In fact, the
[routine](routines/) [StringPrint](strings/stringprint/) is
just a combination of a [for loop](loops/for/) and `printchar`.

### Example

    printchar _temp_array[2] ! prints the third element character of _temp_array
