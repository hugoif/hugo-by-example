**examine** is a [verb](/declarations/verb/) defined by the
[standard library](/library/). It is used by the user to obtain
more information about a specific object. It basically displays the
[long_desc](/properties/descriptions/) [property](/properties/) of
the [object](/globals/object/) if it has it, or gives a generic message
if the object does not have that property.
