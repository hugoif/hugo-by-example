Someone looking to play a Hugo game has several choices of interpreter:

1.  [Hugo_engine](/interpreters/he/)- As the official Hugo
    interpreter, in many cases, this is what is encouraged among
    players. Unfortunately, Mac and Linux players often have trouble
    getting it set up, and movies no longer work under Windows 7.
2.  [Hugor](/interpreters/hugor/)- Newcomer to the scene, interpreter Hugor
    is a godsend to Mac and Linux players- and makes some nice design
    decisions to boot. For one thing, music is muted, not paused, when
    the screen is minimized, allowing authors to know exactly when songs
    will end. It doesn't play movies, but as far as Windows 7 is
    concerned, it also means the program won't hang.
3.  [Gargoyle](/interpreters/gargoyle/)- A popular
    [glk](/definitions/glk/)-based "multi-interpreter".

There are several other interpreters (of course, even the
[Debugger](/basics/debugger/) can be used as an interpreter), but
those three are the most popular. Just the same, some others-

1.  **Hugo winglk**- There are some (well, at least one) official Hugo
    glk interpreters. It is an okay way to test glk functionality, but
    it was last updated years ago and could be very misleading. Using
    something like Gargoyle is recommended instead.
2.  [Zoom](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Zoom)- Mac and Linux players also
    have the multi-interpreter Zoom available to them. It doesn't
    support graphics and such but is likely a decent choice for
    non-multimedia games.
3.  **ggzc ("the poor man's interactive fiction player")**- This
    bare-bones Linux interpreter may be a good way to check out how a
    game looks in a [cheapglk](/definitions/cheapglk/) interpreter.
4.  **IFP**- Some kind of Linux multi-interpreter.
