**Hugor** is a Hugo interpreter, created by Nikos Chantziaras, developed
due to issues in the Macintosh and Linux versions of the Hugo
interpreters for those systems. It runs on Linux (but other Unix systems
as well if compiled from source code), Mac OS X (10.5 and newer) and
Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista and 7).

### Features exclusive to Hugor

-   If you rename the Hugor executable to share the name of a Hugo game
    file (.hex) in the same directory, opening the executable will
    automatically open the game. This makes it easier to share games
    with the IF-interpreter-unsavvy.
-   When minimized, music is muted but not paused. This allows Hugo
    authors to predict exactly when a song will end.
-   The menu bar does not have commands like SAVE, RESTORE, and RESTART
    that may completely ignore the in-game code for doing the same thing
    (so an author can successfully keep track of how many times a game
    has been restarted).

### What is missing

Hugor does not support movies or context menus.
